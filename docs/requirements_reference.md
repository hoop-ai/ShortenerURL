# Original Requirements (Verbatim)

```
Since software is used in every part of our lives, its reliability, safety and security are must requirements. Ensuring, with high confidence, that software systems behave according to their specification (verification) and serves the planned purpose (validation) are significant activities for software development. That’s why using related verification and validation techniques are critical to reduce software development cost and increase software quality. The objective of this course in to cover software verification and validation with focus on formal verification and software testing.

Course Learning Outcomes

The students who have succeeded in this course;

1. Identify and explain the concepts and theory related to software verification, validation, general concepts and theory related to software testing.

2. Define the concepts and theory related to model-based testing, model-checking and know how to apply these.

3. Describe the concepts and theory related to run-time verification and know how to apply these.

4. Demonstrate an understanding of selecting and applying appropriate software verification and validation techniques in development projects.

5. Describe the possibilities and limitations of software verification and validation.

6. Learn to use automated verification and validation tools.

Contribution of the Course to the Program

The Software Verification and Validation course provides Software Engineering students with the knowledge and skills to ensure software quality and reliability. It emphasizes techniques for testing, formal verification, and validation throughout the software development lifecycle. This course strengthens students’ ability to detect, prevent, and correct software defects, preparing them for advanced work in software quality assurance and dependable system development.

SEN4013 SOFTWARE VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION PROJECT ASSIGNMENT

1. DEFINITION

The project assignment consists of the following four parts:

Part 1: A Review of Automated Tools

Prepare a review of automated software verification, validation, and testing tools. Your review should give an overview of key findings, concepts, and developments in this domain.

Part 2: Verification and Validation Activities

Choose a project.

a. Proposed by the students (you may use previously developed code, GitHub, …).

b. Analyze / test (if possible real-world) code to validate and verify the software.

* Design test cases and apply various testing approaches (functional, structural, …).

Part 3: Preparing the Project Report

Prepare a report of your work on verification and validation activities. Your report should contain the following main parts:

a. Introduction (purpose).

b. Objectives and scope of the software.

c. Test cases and test results.

d. Recommendations.

Save your project report in PDF format.

Part 4: Presentation

Record a video presentation about your project (in English).

a. Each group member should present his/her part of the project.

b. Each group member has at most five minutes.

c. If you do not make your presentation, your project grade will be zero.

2. PROJECT GROUPS

Students should form project groups consisting of up to five people. Each group will organize task responsibilities individually. Tasks must be shared equally between group members. If a student leaves the group, the rest of the members must cover his/her duties. If you can’t form a project group, you are free to work alone.

3. IMPORTANT DATES

a. Creating Project Groups: 31 October 2025 17:30

* If you are willing to study alone, submit yourself as a one-member group.

* Students without a project group will be assigned to project groups randomly after this deadline.

b. Project Submission Deadline: 16 January 2026 17:30

c. Presentation Submission Deadline: 16 January 2026 17:30

4. GRADING

Part 1: 35 pts.

Part 2: 35 pts.

Part 3: 20 pts.

Part 4: 10 pts.

5. SUBMISSION RULES

All submissions must be done on time. For each late submission, the grade will be reduced by 10% per day. All submissions will be handled Microsoft Teams. Reports sent via e-mail or messaging system will not be accepted.

6. CHEATING AND PLAGIARISM

Detected cheating and plagiarism are subject to disciplinary action.
